The **Amazon Web Services (AWS) JDBC Driver** has been redesigned as an advanced JDBC wrapper.

The wrapper is complementary to an existing JDBC driver and aims to extend the functionality of the driver to enable applications to take full advantage of the features of clustered databases such as Amazon Aurora. In other words, the AWS JDBC Driver does not connect directly to any database, but enables support of AWS and Aurora functionalities on top of an underlying JDBC driver of the user's choice. This approach enables service-specific enhancements, without requiring users to change their workflow and existing JDBC driver tooling.

The AWS JDBC Driver is targeted to work with **any** existing JDBC driver. Currently, the AWS JDBC Driver has been validated to support the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc), [MySQL JDBC Driver](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j), and [MariaDB JDBC Driver](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-connector-j).

The AWS JDBC Driver provides modular functionality through feature plugins, with each plugin being relevant to specific services based on their architecture and capabilities. For example, [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) authentication is supported across multiple services, while [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) applies to services that support password-based authentication. The fast failover plugin provides reduced recovery time during failover for Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL clusters, though it is not applicable to Aurora DSQL due to its active-active architecture.

## Benefits of the AWS JDBC Driver

### Seamless AWS Service Integration

Built-in support for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication eliminates the need to manage database passwords, while AWS Secrets Manager integration provides secure credential management for services that require password-based authentication.

### Preserve Existing Workflows

The wrapper design allows developers to continue using their preferred JDBC drivers and existing database code while gaining service-specific enhancements. No application rewrites are required.

### Modular Plugin Architecture

The plugin-based design ensures applications only load the functionality they need, reducing dependencies and overhead.

## Benefits for Aurora PostgreSQL, Aurora MySQL, and RDS

### Faster Failover and Reduced Downtime

For Aurora PostgreSQL, Aurora MySQL, and RDS Multi-AZ DB clusters, the driver significantly reduces connection recovery time during [database failovers](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/WhatIsFailover.md). By maintaining a real-time cache of cluster topology and bypassing DNS resolution delays, applications can reconnect to healthy database instances in seconds rather than minutes.

### Enhanced Failure Detection

The driver includes Enhanced Failure Monitoring (EFM) that proactively monitors database node health, detecting failures faster than traditional timeout-based approaches. This allows applications to respond to issues before they impact end users.

## Using the AWS JDBC Driver with...

### Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL

The AWS JDBC Driver provides fast failover capabilities for Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL clusters, significantly reducing connection recovery time during database failovers.

Visit [this page](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheFailover2Plugin.md) for more details.

### Amazon Aurora DSQL

The AWS JDBC Driver is able to handle IAM authentication when working with AWS Aurora DSQL clusters.

Visit [this page](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheDsqlAuthenticationPlugin.md) for more details.

### Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB Clusters

The [AWS RDS Multi-AZ DB Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html) are capable of switching over the current writer node to another node in the cluster within approximately 1 second or less, in case of minor engine version upgrade or OS maintenance operations. The AWS JDBC Driver has been optimized for such fast failover when working with AWS RDS Multi-AZ DB Clusters.

With the `failover` plugin, the downtime during certain DB cluster operations, such as engine minor version upgrades, can be reduced to one second or even less with finely tuned parameters. It supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL clusters.

Visit [this page](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/SupportForRDSMultiAzDBCluster.md) for more details.

### Plain Amazon RDS databases

The AWS JDBC Driver also works with RDS provided databases that are not Aurora.

Visit [this page](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/UsingTheJdbcDriver.md#using-the-aws-jdbc-driver-with-plain-rds-databases) for more details.

## Logging
Enabling logging is a very useful mechanism for troubleshooting any issue one might potentially experience while using the AWS JDBC Driver.

In order to learn how to enable and configure logging, check out the [Logging](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/UsingTheJdbcDriver.md#logging) section.

## Documentation
Technical documentation regarding the functionality of the AWS JDBC Driver will be maintained in this GitHub repository. Since the AWS JDBC Driver requires an underlying JDBC driver, please refer to the individual driver's documentation for driver-specific information.

### Using the AWS JDBC Driver
To find all the documentation and concrete examples on how to use the AWS JDBC Driver, please refer to the [AWS JDBC Driver Documentation](./docs/Documentation.md) page.

### Known Limitations

#### Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments

Although the AWS Advanced JDBC Wrapper is not compatible with [AWS Blue/Green Deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html) and does not officially support them, the combination of the AWS Advanced JDBC Wrapper and the Failover Plugin has been validated for use with clusters that employ Blue/Green Deployments. While general basic connectivity to both Blue and Green clusters is always in place, some failover cases are not fully supported.

The current limitations are:
- After a Blue/Green switchover, the wrapper may not be able to properly detect the new topology and handle failover, as there are discrepancies between the metadata and the available endpoints.
- The specific version requirements for Aurora MySQL versus Aurora PostgreSQL may vary, as the internal systems used by the wrapper can differ[^1].

The development team is aware of these limitations and is working to improve the wrapper's awareness and handling of Blue/Green switchovers. In the meantime, users can consider utilizing the `enableGreenNodeReplacement` configuration parameter, which allows the driver to override incorrect topology metadata and try to connect to available new Blue endpoints.

> [!WARNING]\
> **Blue/Green Support Behaviour and Version Compatibility**
>
> The AWS Advanced JDBC Wrapper now includes enhanced full support for Blue/Green Deployments. This support requires a minimum database version that includes a specific metadata table. This constraint **does not** apply to RDS MySQL.
>
> If your database version does **not** support this table, the driver will automatically detect its absence and fallback to its previous behaviour. In this fallback mode, Blue/Green handling is subject to the same limitations listed above.
>
> **No action is required** if your database does not include the new metadata table -- the driver will continue to operate as before. If you have questions or encounter issues, please open an issue in this repository.
>
> Supported RDS PostgreSQL Versions: `rds_tools v1.7 (17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, 12.21)` and above.<br>
> Supported Aurora PostgreSQL Versions: Engine Release `17.5, 16.9, 15.13, 14.18, 13.21` and above.<br>
> Supported Aurora MySQL Versions: Engine Release `3.07` and above.

[^1]: Aurora MySQL requires v3.07 or later.

#### Amazon Aurora Global Databases

This driver currently does not support `planned failover` or `switchover` of Amazon Aurora Global Databases. Failing over to a secondary cluster will result in errors and there may be additional unforeseen errors when working with global databases. Connecting to the primary cluster is fully supported. There is a limitation when connected to the secondary cluster; the [failover2 plugin](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheFailover2Plugin.md) will not work on the secondary cluster, however the [failover plugin](./docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheFailoverPlugin.md) will work. When working with Global Databases and accepting the driver's limited support, ensure you explicitly provide a list of plugins. This is crucial because the `failover2` plugin, which is enabled by default, does not support Global Databases as previously mentioned. By specifying `failover` plugin along with your desired plugins, you can ensure (still limited) functionality with Global Databases. Full Support for Amazon Aurora Global Databases is in the backlog, but we cannot comment on a timeline right now.
