  - The ConnectionPlugin interface has introduced three new methods: forceConnect, acceptsStrategy, and getHostSpecByStrategy. Although the AbstractConnectionPlugin implements default behavior for these methods, you should consider adding your own implementations if you have implemented a custom ConnectionPlugin. More details on these methods can be found in the ConnectionPlugin Javadocs and the [pipelines documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/docs/development-guide/Pipelines.md).
  - The HostListProvider interface has introduced a new method: getHostRole. If you have implemented your own HostListProvider, you will need to implement this method. More details on this method can be found in the HostListProvider Javadocs.

- Runtime exceptions thrown as reported in [issue #284](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/284).
- Incorrect log message in `PluginServiceImpl#setAvailability` that says host alias not found instead of empty hosts change list.
- FailoverTimeoutMS not being obeyed during failover, causing failover to take twice as long ([PR #244](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/244)).
- Reader failover sometimes reconnect to writer instances as reported by [Issue #223](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/223). Applications can now set the `failoverStrictReader` parameter to only allow failover to reader nodes during the reader failover process.
