# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200).

## [2.2.5] - 2023-10-03
### :magic_wand: Added
- Optional preservation of partial session state post failover ([PR #632](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/632)).
- Round Robin host selection strategy ([PR #603](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/603)).
- Sample application failover retry with Spring Boot ([PR #638](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/638)).

### :crab: Changed
- Renamed the `messages.properties` file to `aws_advanced_jdbc_wrapper_messages.properties` ([Issue #633](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/633)).

## [2.2.4] - 2023-08-29
### :magic_wand: Added
- Host Availability Strategy to help keep host health status up to date ([PR #530](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/530)).
- Implement `setLoginTimeout` from a suggested enhancement ([Discussion #509](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/discussions/509)).

### :bug: Fixed
- Allow connecting with reader cluster endpoints for Aurora PostgreSQL versions 13.9 and greater by changing the `AuroraPgDialect` topology query ([Issue #593](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/593)).
- Race condition issues between `MonitorThreadContainer#getInstance()` and `MonitorThreadContainer#releaseInstance()` ([PR #601](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/601)).

### :crab: Changed
- Dynamically sets the default host list provider based on the dialect used. User applications no longer need to manually set the AuroraHostListProvider when connecting to Aurora Postgres or Aurora MySQL databases.
- Deprecated AuroraHostListConnectionPlugin.
  - As an enhancement, the wrapper is now able to automatically set the Aurora host list provider for connections to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL databases.
    Aurora Host List Connection Plugin is deprecated. If you were using the `AuroraHostListConnectionPlugin`, you can simply remove the plugin from the `wrapperPlugins` parameter.
    However, if you choose to, you can ensure the provider is used by specifying a topology-aware dialect, for more information, see [Database Dialects](docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/DatabaseDialects.md).
- Propagate `Connection.clearWarnings()` to underlying connections in the Read Write Splitting Plugin so that the connection object does not accumulate warning messages  ([Issue #547](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/547)).
- Close underlying connections in the Read Write Splitting Plugin after switching to read-write or read-only depending on whether internal connection pooling is used ([PR #583](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/583)).
- Sort plugins by default to prevent plugin misconfiguration. This can be disabled by setting the property `autoSortWrapperPluginOrder` to false ([PR #542](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/542)).
- Documentation:
  - Clarified AWS JDBC Driver limitations with Blue/Green deployments. See [Known Limitations](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/docs/KnownLimitations.md#amazon-rds-bluegreen-deployments).
  - Updated and reworded main [README.md](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/README.md) page.

## [2.2.3] - 2023-07-28

### :bug: Fixed
- Pruned null connections in connection tracker plugins ([PR #461](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/461)).
- HikariCP integration tests and reworked AwsWrapperDataSource by removing property names, introduced a set of simple properties to set database, server name and server port ([PR #468](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/468)).
- Checkstyle failure due to modified license and driver connection provider passing original properties resulting properties being overridden for subsequent connections ([PR #471](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/471)).
- IamAuthConnectionPlugin to properly prioritize the override property IAM_DEFAULT_PORT then Hosts port, and then Dialect port ([Issue #473](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/473)).
- Values for the `wrapperLoggerLevel` parameter are no longer case-sensitive ([#PR #481](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/481)).

- Potential security concern by ensuring that user-specific connections in the connection pool are returned to the correct user ([PR #432](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/432)).
- Connection state transfer bug where switching from read-only connection to writer connection incorrectly triggers the failover process ([Issue #426](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/426)).
- Incorrect invalidation of the newly promoted writer and random readers after failover. EFM plugin to use instance endpoint as the monitoring endpoint in case the initial connection is established using cluster endpoint ([PR #431](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/431)).
- Running Hibernate tests no longer runs unrelated tests ([PR #417](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/417)).
- Reader failover using a shared Properties object resulting in race conditions ([PR #436](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/436) & [PR #438](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/438)).
- Temporarily setting the socket timeout for the topology query if it is not set, to avoid topology query from executing indefinitely ([PR #416](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/416)).

### :crab: Changed
- Removed logic from the failover plugin that changes connection to a writer instance when `setReadOnly(false)` is called on a reader connection ([Issue #426](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/426)). This functionality already exists in the read write splitting plugin.
- Removed Multi-writer cluster related code as they are no longer supported ([PR #435](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/435)).
- Clarified documentation on the failover process to account for Aurora PostgreSQL clusters being offline during failover ([PR #437](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/437)).
- :warning: Breaking changes were introduced with the new `failoverMode` configuration parameter ([PR #434](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/434)):
    - The `failoverMode` parameter replaces the `enableFailoverStrictReader` configuration parameter.
    - If you were previously using `enableFailoverStrictReader=true`, please update it to `failoverMode=strict-reader`.
    - For more information, please check the ([documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheFailoverPlugin.md#failover-parameters))

- :warning: Breaking changes were introduced with the internal connection pool changes ([PR #359](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/359)):
  - The ConnectionPlugin interface has introduced three new methods: forceConnect, acceptsStrategy, and getHostSpecByStrategy. Although the AbstractConnectionPlugin implements default behavior for these methods, you should consider adding your own implementations if you have implemented a custom ConnectionPlugin. More details on these methods can be found in the ConnectionPlugin Javadocs and the [pipelines documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/docs/development-guide/Pipelines.md).
  - The HostListProvider interface has introduced a new method: getHostRole. If you have implemented your own HostListProvider, you will need to implement this method. More details on this method can be found in the HostListProvider Javadocs.

- FailoverTimeoutMS not being obeyed during failover, causing failover to take twice as long ([PR #244](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/pull/244)).
- Reader failover sometimes reconnect to writer instances as reported by [Issue #223](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/issues/223). Applications can now set the `failoverStrictReader` parameter to only allow failover to reader nodes during the reader failover process. See more details [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheFailoverPlugin.md#failover-parameters).
