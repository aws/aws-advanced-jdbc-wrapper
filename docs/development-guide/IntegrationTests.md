# Integration Tests

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop:
    - [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
    - [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [Environment variables](#Environment-Variables)

##### Aurora Test Requirements
- An AWS account with:
    - RDS permissions
    - EC2 permissions so integration tests can add the current IP address in the Aurora cluster's EC2 security group.
    - For more information, see: [Setting Up for Amazon RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html).

- An available Aurora PostgreSQL or MySQL DB cluster is required if you're running the tests against an existing DB cluster.

### Aurora Integration Tests

The Aurora integration tests are focused on testing connection strings and failover capabilities of any driver.
The tests are run in Docker but make a connection to test against an Aurora cluster.
PostgreSQL and MySQL tests are currently supported.

### Standard Integration Tests

These integration tests are focused on testing connection strings against a local database inside a Docker container.
PostgreSQL and MySQL tests are currently supported.

### Environment Variables

If the environment variable `REUSE_AURORA_CLUSTER` is set to true, the integration tests will use the existing cluster defined by your environment variables. Otherwise, the integration tests will create a new Aurora cluster and then delete it automatically when the tests are done. Note that you will need a valid Docker environment to run any of the integration tests because they are run using a Docker environment as a host. The appropriate Docker containers will be created automatically when you run the tests, so you will not need to execute any Docker commands manually.

>**Note:** if you are running tests against an existing cluster, the tests will only run against the Aurora database engine of that cluster. For example, if you specify a MySQL cluster using the environment variables, only the MySQL tests will be run even if you pick test-all-aurora as the task. To run against Postgres instead, you will need to change your environment variables

### Running the Integration Tests

To run the integration tests, you can select from a number of tasks:
- `test-all-environments`: run all Aurora and standard database tests
- `test-all-docker`: run all standard database tests
- `test-all-aurora`: run all Aurora tests
- `debug-all-environments`: debug all Aurora and standard database tests
- `debug-all-docker`: debug all standard database tests
- `debug-all-aurora`: debug all Aurora tests

For example, to run all integration tests, you can use the following commands:

macOS:
```bash
./gradlew --no-parallel --no-daemon test-all-environments
```

Windows:
```bash
cmd /c ./gradlew --no-parallel --no-daemon test-all-environments
```

Test results can be found at `wrapper/build/report/index.html`.
