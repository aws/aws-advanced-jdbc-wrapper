      <section>
        <p>Developers use software libraries, known as database connectivity drivers (or simply drivers), to connect
          applications to databases. A driver converts SQL queries in an application into a protocol language to
          communicate with the database and returns query results to the application. The AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL
          is optimally configured to allow an application to connect to and take advantage of the features of clustered
          PostgreSQL database deployments.
        <p><b>Supporting Fast Failover for Amazon Aurora</b><br>In Amazon Aurora, failover is a mechanism by which the
          database automatically repairs the cluster status when a primary DB instance becomes unavailable. During failover, 
          Aurora elects a database replica to become the new primary DB instance, so the cluster can provide
          maximum availability to a primary read-write DB instance.</p>
        <p>Before a replica instance can be promoted to the primary DB instance, the DNS record must be updated in order
          to properly direct the connection. This process can take up to several minutes. The AWS JDBC Driver for
          PostgreSQL is designed to coordinate with this behavior in order to provide minimal downtime. It achieves this
          by maintaining a cache of the PostgreSQL cluster topology and each instance's role (replica or primary DB
          instance). This topology is provided via a direct query to the PostgreSQL database, providing a shortcut to
          bypass the delays caused by DNS resolution. With this knowledge, the AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL can more
          closely monitor the database cluster status so that a connection to the new primary DB instance can be
          established as quickly as possible.</p>

            The AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL is based on and is drop-in compatible with the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver,
            so you can replace it in your application with few code changes.

            In the event of an Amazon Aurora primary DB failure, the AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL supports fast
            failover to a database replica, resulting in minimal impact to application availability and user experience.

          <header>What does drop-in compatible mean?</header>
          <section>
            The AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL is compatible with all PostgreSQL deployments, whether they be
            on-premises or in the cloud. It currently supports fast failover capabilities for Amazon Aurora with
            PostgreSQL compatibility only. The driver is based on and is drop-in compatible with the PostgreSQL JDBC
            Driver. Changes to the connection string is all that is needed. Support for additional features of clustered
            databases, including features of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and on-premises PostgreSQL deployments, is
            planned.

          <section>
            The AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL is an advanced wrapper, and is drop-in compatible for the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. To replace
            your existing driver with the AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL, follow the same steps used to update the
            current driver. Then, update the client connection string to use the AWS protocol when connecting. For details about Getting Started,

            Enhanced Failure Monitoring (EFM) is a feature available from the Host Monitoring Connection Plugin that periodically checks 
            the connected database node's health and availability. If a database node is determined to be unhealthy, the connection is aborted. For
            more information about the Host Monitoring Connection Plugin, visit <a
