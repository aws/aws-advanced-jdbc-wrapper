# Using the AWS Advanced JDBC Driver
The AWS Advanced JDBC Driver leverages community JDBC drivers and enables support of AWS and Aurora functionalities. Currently, only the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc) is supported.
The JDBC Wrapper also supports [connection pooling](./DataSource.md#Using-the-AwsWrapperDataSource-with-Connection-Pooling-Frameworks).

## Wrapper Protocol
The AWS JDBC Driver uses the protocol prefix `jdbc:aws-wrapper:`. Internally, the JDBC Wrapper will replace this protocol prefix with `jdbc:`, making the final protocol `jdbc:aws-wrapper:{suffix}` where `suffix` is specific to the desired underlying protocol. For example, to connect to a PostgreSQL database, you would use the protocol `jdbc:aws-wrapper:postgresql:`, and inside the AWS JDBC Driver, the final protocol that will be used to connect to a database will be `jdbc:postgresql:`.

## Getting a Connection
To get a connection from the AWS JDBC Driver, the user application can either connect with a DriverManager or with a DataSource.

The process of getting a connection with a DriverManager will remain the same as with other JDBC Drivers;
[this example](../driver-specific/postgresql/ConnectionSample.java) demonstrates establishing a connection with the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.

Establishing a connection with a DataSource may require some additional steps.
For detailed information and examples, review the [Datasource](./DataSource.md) documentation.

### Connections with Different Query Lengths
It is recommended that user applications use different settings for connections or connection pools that execute queries of varying lengths. Long and short running queries have different preferred settings. For example, if the network timeout is set to 1 minute, given an application that executes both short running (~5 seconds) and long running (~1 minute) queries, the user would be waiting a large amount of time for the short running queries to time out. Alternatively, if the timeout is set to 5 seconds, the user would experience large numbers of false negatives in which the long queries are consistently failing due to the timeout. 
<br>
**Note:** User applications with queries of varying lengths should also take into consideration any plugin configuration parameters that could be utilized to facilitate the needs of the application.

## Integration with 3rd Party Frameworks
The JDBC Wrapper can be used with different frameworks and tools. More details for some frameworks can be found [here](./Frameworks.md).

## Logging
The AWS JDBC Driver uses the Java Util Logger built-in library functionality to log information. To enable logging and see information logged by the AWS JDBC Driver:

1. Create a `.properties` file and configure the logging level.
2. Specify the `.properties` file with the `java.util.logging.config.file` option; for example, 
   `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=absolute\path\to\logging.properties`.

An example  `.properties` file is as follows:

```properties
# Possible values for log level (from most detailed to less detailed): FINEST, FINER, FINE, CONFIG, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE
.level=INFO
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL
software.amazon.jdbc.Driver.level=FINER
software.amazon.jdbc.plugin.level=FINER
```

The AWS JDBC Driver also has a parameter, [`wrapperLoggerLevel`](#aws-advanced-jdbc-driver-parameters), to configure the logging level.

## AWS Advanced JDBC Driver Parameters
These parameters are applicable to any instance of the AWS JDBC Driver.

| Parameter                       | Value     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                          | Default Value |

## Plugins
The AWS JDBC Driver uses plugins to execute JDBC methods. You can think of a plugin as an extensible code module that adds extra logic around any JDBC method calls. The AWS JDBC Driver has a number of [built-in plugins](#list-of-available-plugins) available for use. 

Plugins are loaded and managed through the Connection Plugin Manager and may be identified by a `String` name in the form of plugin code.

### Connection Plugin Manager Parameters

| Parameter            | Value    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | Default Value                          |
|----------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `wrapperPlugins`     | `String` | No       | Comma separated list of connection plugin codes. <br><br>Example: `failover,efm`                                                                                                                     | `auroraConnectionTracker,failover,efm` | 
| `wrapperProfileName` | `String` | No       | Driver configuration profile name. Instead of listing plugin codes with `wrapperPlugins`, the driver profile can be set with this parameter. <br><br> Example: See [below](#configuration-profiles). | `null`                                 |

To use a built-in plugin, specify its relevant plugin code for the `wrapperPlugins`.
The default value for `wrapperPlugins` is `auroraConnectionTracker,failover,efm`. These 3 plugins are enabled by default. To read more about these plugins, see the [List of Available Plugins](#list-of-available-plugins) section.
To override the default plugins, simply provide a new value for `wrapperPlugins`.
For instance, to use the [IAM Authentication Connection Plugin](./using-plugins/UsingTheIamAuthenticationPlugin.md) and the [Failover Connection Plugin](./using-plugins/UsingTheFailoverPlugin.md):

```java
properties.setProperty("wrapperPlugins", "iam,failover");
```

> :exclamation:**NOTE**: The plugins will be initialized and executed in the order they have been specified.

Provide an empty string to disable all plugins:
```java
properties.setProperty("wrapperPlugins", "");
```
The Wrapper behaves like the target driver when no plugins are used.

### Configuration Profiles
An alternative way of loading plugins is to use a configuration profile. You can create custom configuration profiles that specify which plugins the AWS JDBC Driver should load. After creating the profile, set the [`wrapperProfileName`](#connection-plugin-manager-parameters) parameter to the name of the created profile.
Although you can use this method of loading plugins, this method will most often be used by those who require custom plugins that cannot be loaded with the [`wrapperPlugins`](#connection-plugin-manager-parameters) parameter.
The following example creates and sets a configuration profile:

```java
properties.setProperty("wrapperProfileName", "testProfile");
DriverConfigurationProfiles.addOrReplaceProfile(
    "testProfile",
    Arrays.asList(
        FailoverConnectionPluginFactory.class, 
        HostMonitoringConnectionPluginFactory.class,
        CustomConnectionPluginFactory.class));
```

### Using a Snapshot of the Driver
If there is an unreleased feature you would like to try, it may be available in a snapshot build of the driver. Snapshot builds can be found [here](https://aws.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/software/amazon/jdbc/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/). To use a snapshot, find the desired `.jar` file, which will be named `aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper-<version>-<date>-<time>-<snapshot-number>.jar`, and add it to your project as a dependency.

#### As a Maven dependency
```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>path-to-snapshot-jar</systemPath>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### As a Gradle dependency
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation(files("path-to-snapshot-jar"))
}
```
