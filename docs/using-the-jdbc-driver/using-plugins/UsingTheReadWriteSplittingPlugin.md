## Read-Write Splitting Plugin

The read-write splitting plugin adds functionality to switch between writer/reader instances via calls to the `Connection#setReadOnly` method. Upon calling `setReadOnly(true)`, the plugin will establish a connection to a random reader instance and direct subsequent queries to this instance. Future calls to `setReadOnly` will switch between the established writer and reader connections according to the boolean argument you supply to the `setReadOnly` method.

### Session State Limitations with the Read-Write Splitting Plugin

There are many session state attributes that can change during a session, and many ways to change them. Consequently, the read-write splitting plugin has limited support for transferring session state between connections. The following attributes will be automatically transferred when switching connections:

- autocommit value
- transaction isolation level

All other session state attributes will be lost when switching connections. There are two scenarios when the plugin may switch a connection:
1. You have loaded the plugin but have kept reader load balancing disabled. In this case, the connection will switch between the writer/reader when calling `setReadOnly`.
2. You have loaded the plugin and have enabled reader load balancing. In this case, the connection will still switch between the writer/reader when calling `setReadOnly`. It will also switch at transaction boundaries. See the section on [reader load balancing](#reader-load-balancing) for more information on what is consided a transaction boundary.

If your SQL workflow depends on session state attributes that are not mentioned above, you will need to re-configure those attributes whenever the connection is switched. If you have loaded the plugin but have kept reader load balancing disabled, you will need to re-configure these attributes after each call to `setReadOnly`. If reader load balancing is enabled, you will also need to re-configure these attributes after each transaction boundary. Since reader load balancing frequently switches the connection, we recommend that you keep it disabled if your workflow depends on session state attributes that are not automatically transferred.

### Loading the Read-Write Splitting Plugin

The read-write splitting plugin is not loaded by default. To load the plugin, include it in the `wrapperPlugins` connection parameter:
```
final Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty(PropertyDefinition.PLUGINS.name, "readWriteSplitting,failover,efm");
```

If you would like to load the read-write splitting plugin alongside the failover and host monitoring plugins, the read-write splitting plugin must be the first plugin in the connection chain, otherwise failover exceptions will not be properly processed by the plugin. See the example above to properly load the read-write splitting plugin with the failover and host monitoring plugins.

If you would like to use the read-write splitting plugin without the failover plugin against an Aurora cluster, you will need to include the Aurora host list plugin before the read-write splitting plugin. This informs the driver that it should query for Aurora's topology.
```
final Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty(PropertyDefinition.PLUGINS.name, "auroraHostList,readWriteSplitting");
```
### Reader Load Balancing

The plugin can also load balance queries among available reader instances by enabling the `loadBalanceReadOnlyTraffic` connection parameter. This parameter is disabled by default. To enable it, set the following connection parameter:
```
properties.setProperty(ReadWriteSplittingPlugin.LOAD_BALANCE_READ_ONLY_TRAFFIC.name, "true");
```

Once this parameter is enabled and `setReadOnly(true)` has been called on the `Connection` object, the plugin will switch to a new randomly selected reader instance at each transaction boundary. The following scenarios are considered transaction boundaries:
- After calling `commit()` or `rollback()`
- After executing `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` or `ABORT` as a SQL statement
- After executing any SQL statement while autocommit is on, with the following exceptions:
    - The statement started a transaction via `BEGIN` or `START TRANSACTION`
    - The statement began with `SET`, `USE`, or `SHOW`

### Limitations with Reader Load Balancing

When reader load balancing is enabled, the read-write splitting plugin will analyze methods and statements executed against the Connection object to determine when the connection is at a transaction boundary. This analysis does not support SQL strings containing multiple statements. If your SQL strings contain multiple statements, we recommend that you do not enable reader load balancing as the resulting behavior is not defined. If a SQL string with multiple statements is provided, the plugin will only analyze the first statement.

### Using the Read-Write Splitting Plugin against RDS/Aurora Clusters

When using the read-write splitting plugin against RDS or Aurora clusters, you do not have to supply multiple instance URLs in the connection string. Instead, supply just the URL for the initial instance to which you're connecting. You must also include either the failover plugin or the Aurora host list plugin in your plugin chain so that the driver knows to query Aurora for its topology. See the section on [loading the read-write splitting plugin](#loading-the-read-write-splitting-plugin) for more info.
### Using the Read-Write Splitting Plugin against Non-RDS Clusters

If you are using the read-write splitting plugin against a cluster that is not hosted on RDS or Aurora, the plugin will not be able to automatically acquire the cluster topology. Instead, you must supply the topology information in the connection string as a comma-delimited list of multiple instance URLs. If you are using a single writer instance, the first instance in the list must be the writer instance and you must enable the `singleWriterConnectionString` property:

```
properties.setProperty(ConnectionStringHostListProvider.SINGLE_WRITER_CONNECTION_STRING.name, "true");
String connectionUrl = "jdbc:aws-wrapper:mysql://writer-instance-1.com,reader-instance-1.com,reader-instance-2.com/database-name"
```

Additionally, you should avoid using the Aurora host list plugin and the failover plugin in this scenario, as they are designed to specifically operate against Aurora databases.

### Read Write Splitting Plugin Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Required | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `loadBalanceReadOnlyTraffic` | Boolean | No  | Set to `true` to load balance queries among available reader instances. Once enabled, load balancing will automatically be performed for reader instances when the connection has been set to read-only mode via `Connection#setReadOnly` | `false` |
