# Failover Plugin v2
The AWS Advanced JDBC Driver uses the Failover Plugin v2 to provide minimal downtime in the event of a DB instance failure. The plugin is the next version (v2) of the [Failover Plugin](./UsingTheFailoverPlugin.md) and unless explicitly stated otherwise, most of the information and suggestions for the Failover Plugin are applicable to the Failover Plugin v2.

## Differences between the Failover Plugin and the Failover Plugin v2

The Failover Plugin performs a failover process for each DB connection. Each failover process is triggered independently and is unrelated to failover processes in other connections. While such independence between failover processes has some benefits, it also leads to additional resources like extra threads. If dozens of DB connections are failing over at the same time, it may cause significant load on a client environment.

<br><br>

If a connection needs to get the latest topology, it calls `RdsHostListProvider`. It should be noted that `RdsHostListProvider` runs in the same thread as a connection failover process. As shown in _Picture 1_ above, different connections start and end their failover processes independently.

The Failover Plugin v2 uses an optimized approach where the process of detecting and confirming a cluster topology is delegated to a central topology monitoring component that runs in a separate thread. When the topology is confirmed and a new writer is detected, each waiting connection can resume and reconnect to a required node. This design helps minimize resources required for failover processing and scales better compared to the Failover Plugin.

<br><br>

If two connections encounter communication issues with their internal (physical) DB connections, each connection may send a request to the topology monitoring component (`MonitoringRdsHostListProvider` in _Picture 2_) for updated topology information reflecting the new writer. Both connections are notified as soon as the latest topology is available. Connection threads can resume, continue with their suspended workflows, and reconnect to a reader or a writer node as needed.

The topology monitoring component mentioned above (`MonitoringRdsHostListProvider`) updates topology periodically. Usually it uses a connection to a writer node to fetch a cluster topology. Using a connection to a writer node allows to get topology from the first hand without a risk of getting stale data as in case of fetching it from a reader. In some exceptional cases the monitoring component may (temporarily) use a reader connection to fetch a topology however it switch back to a writer node as soon as possible.

<i>Picture 3. MonitoringRdsHostListProvider detects a new writer by establishing connections to nodes in separate threads.</i> 
<br><br>

When the cluster topology needs to be confirmed, the monitoring component opens new threads, one for each node (see _Picture 3_). Each of these threads tries to connect to a node and checks if the node is a writer. When Aurora failover occurs, the new writer node is the first node to reflect the true topology of the cluster. Other nodes connect to the new writer shortly after and update their local copies of the topology. Topology information acquired from a reader node may be outdated/inaccurate for a short period after failover. You can see a typical example of stale topology in the diagram above: thread `instance-3`, box `Topology`, to the right. The stale topology incorrectly shows that `instance-3` is still a writer.

The threads monitoring the topology stop when a new writer is detected. For 30 seconds after a new writer is detected (and after all waiting connections have been notified), topology continues to be updated at an increased rate. This allows time for all readers to appear in the topology, since 30 seconds is usually enough time for cluster failover to complete and cluster topology to stabilize.

All improvements mentioned above help the Failover Plugin v2 to operate with improved performance and less demand for resources. 

A summary of the key differences and between the `failover` and `failover2` plugins is outlined below.
- Each connection performs its own failover process.
- Each connection fetches topology by calling the `RdsHostListProvider` in the same thread.
- Topology may be fetched from a reader node and it may be stale.

With the `failover2` plugin:
- Each connection delegates detection of the new writer to the `MonitoringRdsHostListProvider` (which runs in its own thread) and suspends until the new writer is confirmed.
- The  `MonitoringRdsHostListProvider` tries to connect to every cluster node in parallel.
- The `MonitoringRdsHostListProvider` uses an "Am I a writer?" approach to avoid reliance on stale topology.
- The `MonitoringRdsHostListProvider` continues topology monitoring at an increased rate to ensure all cluster nodes appear in the topology.

## Using the Failover Plugin v2
The Failover Plugin v2 will **NOT** be enabled by default. It must be explicitly included by adding the plugin code `failover2` to the [`wrapperPlugins`](../UsingTheJdbcDriver.md#aws-advanced-jdbc-driver-parameters) value, or by adding it to the current [driver profile](../UsingTheJdbcDriver.md#connection-plugin-manager-parameters). After you load the plugin, the failover feature will be enabled. 

Please refer to the [failover configuration guide](../FailoverConfigurationGuide.md) for tips to keep in mind when using the failover plugin.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use the `failover` and `failover2` plugins at the same time for the same connection! 


### Failover Plugin v2 Configuration Parameters
In addition to the parameters that you can configure for the underlying driver, you can pass the following parameters for the AWS JDBC Driver through the connection URL to specify additional failover behavior.

Please refer to the original [Failover Plugin](./UsingTheFailoverPlugin.md) for more details about error codes, configurations, connection pooling and sample codes. 

### Sample Code
[PostgreSQL Failover Sample Code](./../../../examples/AWSDriverExample/src/main/java/software/amazon/PgFailoverSample.java)

This sample code uses the original `failover` plugin, but it can also be used with the `failover2` plugin. Configuration parameters should be adjusted in accordance with the table above.
