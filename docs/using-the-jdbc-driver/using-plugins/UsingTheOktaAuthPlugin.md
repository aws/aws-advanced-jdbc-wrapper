# Okta Authentication Plugin

The Okta Authentication Plugin adds support for authentication via Federated Identity and then database access via IAM.

## What is Federated Identity
Federated Identity allows users to use the same set of credentials to access multiple services or resources across different organizations. This works by having Identity Providers (IdP) that manage and authenticate user credentials, and Service Providers (SP) that are services or resources that can be internal, external, and/or belonging to various organizations. Multiple SPs can establish trust relationships with a single IdP.

When a user wants access to a resource, it authenticates with the IdP. From this a security token generated and is passed to the SP then grants access to said resource.
In the case of AD FS, the user signs into the AD FS sign in page. This generates a SAML Assertion which acts as a security token. The user then passes the SAML Assertion to the SP when requesting access to resources. The SP verifies the SAML Assertion and grants access to the user.

## Prerequisites
- This plugin requires the following runtime dependencies to be registered separately in the classpath:
  - [AWS Java SDK RDS v2.7.x](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/rds)
  - [AWS Java SDK STS v2.7.x](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/sts)
  - [jsoup](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.jsoup/jsoup)
  - [Jackson Databind](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind)
- Note: The above dependencies may have transitive dependencies that are also required (ex. AWS Java SDK RDS requires [AWS Java SDK Core](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/aws-core/)). If you are not using a package manager such as Maven or Gradle, please refer to Maven Central to determine these transitive dependencies. 
- This plugin does not create or modify any Okta or IAM resources. Okta must be federated into to your AWS IAM account before using this plugin. You can follow Okta's [integration guide](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/deploymentguides/aws/aws-deployment.htm).

> [!NOTE]\
> Since [AWS Java SDK RDS v2.x](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/rds) size is around 5.4Mb (22Mb including all RDS SDK dependencies), some users may experience difficulties using the plugin due to limited available disk size.
> In such cases, the [AWS Java SDK RDS v2.x](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/rds) dependency may be replaced with just two dependencies which have a smaller footprint (around 300Kb in total):
> - [software.amazon.awssdk:http-client-spi](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/http-client-spi)
> - [software.amazon.awssdk:auth](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/auth)
>
> It's recommended to use [AWS Java SDK RDS v2.x](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/rds) when it's possible.

## How to use the Okta Authentication Plugin with the AWS JDBC Driver 

### Enabling the Okta Authentication Plugin
> [!NOTE]\
> AWS IAM database authentication is needed to use the Okta Authentication Plugin. This is because after the plugin
> acquires SAML assertion from the identity provider, the SAML Assertion is then used to acquire an AWS IAM token. The AWS
> IAM token is then subsequently used to access the database.

1. Enable AWS IAM database authentication on an existing database or create a new database with AWS IAM database authentication on the AWS RDS Console:
   - If needed, review the documentation about [IAM authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html).
2. Configure Okta as the AWS identity provider.
    - If needed, review the documentation about [Amazon Web Services Account Federation](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/deploymentguides/aws/aws-deployment.htm) on Okta's documentation.
3. Add the plugin code `okta` to the [`wrapperPlugins`](../UsingTheJdbcDriver.md#connection-plugin-manager-parameters) value, or to the current [driver profile](../UsingTheJdbcDriver.md#connection-plugin-manager-parameters).
4. Specify parameters that are required or specific to your case.
