# Blue/Green Deployment Plugin

## What is Blue/Green Deployment?

The [Blue/Green Deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/blue-green-deployments/introduction.html) technique enables organizations to release applications by seamlessly shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application. This strategy effectively mitigates common risks associated with software deployment, such as downtime and limited rollback capability.

The AWS JDBC Driver leverages the Blue/Green Deployment approach by intelligently managing traffic distribution between blue and green nodes, minimizing the impact of stale DNS data and connectivity disruptions on user applications.

## What is Blue/Green Deployment Plugin?

During a [Blue/Green switchover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments-switching.html), several significant changes occur to your database configuration:
- Connections to blue nodes terminate at a specific point during the transition
- Node connectivity may be temporarily impacted due to reconfigurations and potential node restarts
- Cluster and instance endpoints are redirected to different database nodes
- Internal database node names undergo changes
- Internal security certificates are regenerated to accommodate the new node names


All factors mentioned above may cause application disruption. The AWS Advanced JDBC Driver aims to minimize the application disruption during Blue/Green switchover by performing the following actions:
- Actively monitors Blue/Green switchover status and implements appropriate measures to suspend, pass-through, or re-route database traffic
- Prior to Blue/Green switchover initiation, compiles a comprehensive inventory of cluster and instance endpoints for both blue and green nodes along with their corresponding IP addresses
- During the active switchover phase, temporarily suspends execution of JDBC calls to blue nodes, which helps unload database nodes and reduces transaction lag for green nodes, thereby enhancing overall switchover performance
- Substitutes provided hostnames with corresponding IP addresses when establishing new blue connections, effectively eliminating stale DNS data and ensuring connections to current blue nodes
- During the brief post-switchover period, continuously monitors DNS entries, confirms that blue endpoints have been reconfigured, and discontinues hostname-to-IP address substitution as it becomes unnecessary
- Automatically rejects new connection requests to green nodes when the switchover is completed but DNS entries for green nodes remain temporarily available
- Intelligently detects switchover failures and rollbacks to the original state, implementing appropriate connection handling measures to maintain application stability


## How do I use Blue/Green Deployment Plugin with the AWS JDBC Driver?

To enable the Blue/Green Deployment functionality, add the plugin code `bg` to the [`wrapperPlugins`](../UsingTheJdbcDriver.md#connection-plugin-manager-parameters) parameter value.
The Blue/Green Deployment Plugin supports the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter                     |  Value  | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example Value            |

When supporting multiple Blue/Green Deployments (BGDs), this parameter becomes mandatory. Each connection string must include the `bgdId` parameter with a value that can be any number or string.

The plugin establishes dedicated monitoring connections to track Blue/Green Deployment status. To apply specific configurations to these monitoring connections, add the `blue-green-monitoring-` prefix to any configuration parameter, as shown in the following example:

```java
final Properties properties = new Properties();
// Configure the timeout values for all, non-monitoring connections.
properties.setProperty("connectTimeout", "30000");
properties.setProperty("socketTimeout", "30000");
// Configure different timeout values for the Blue/Green monitoring connections.
properties.setProperty("blue-green-monitoring-connectTimeout", "10000");
properties.setProperty("blue-green-monitoring-socketTimeout", "10000");
```

> [!WARNING]\
> **Always ensure you provide a non-zero socket timeout value or a connect timeout value to the Blue/Green Deployment Plugin**

## Plan your Blue/Green switchover in advance

To optimize Blue/Green switchover support with the AWS JDBC Driver, advance planning is essential. Please follow these recommended steps:

1. Create a Blue/Green Deployment for your database.
2. Configure your application by incorporating the `bg` plugin along with any additional parameters of your choice, then deploy your application to the corresponding environment.
3. The order of steps 1 and 2 is flexible and can be performed in either sequence.
4. Allow sufficient time for the deployed application with the active Blue/Green plugin to collect deployment status information. This process typically requires several minutes.
5. Initiate the Blue/Green Deployment switchover through the AWS Console, CLI, or RDS API.
6. Monitor the process until the switchover completes successfully or rolls back. This may take several minutes.
7. Review the switchover summary in the application logs. This requires setting the log level to `FINE` for either the entire package `software.amazon.jdbc.plugin.bluegreen` or specifically for the class `software.amazon.jdbc.plugin.bluegreen.BlueGreenStatusProvider`.
8. Update your application by deactivating the `bg` plugin through its removal from your application configuration. Redeploy your application afterward. Note that an active Blue/Green plugin produces no adverse effects once the switchover has been completed.
9. Delete the Blue/Green Deployment through the appropriate AWS interface.
10. The sequence of steps 8 and 9 is flexible and can be executed in either order based on your preference.

Here's an example of a switchover summary. Time zero corresponds to the beginning of the active switchover phase. Time offsets indicate the start time of each specific switchover phase.
